# Image-recognition-neural-network
A neural network using the tensorflow, cv2. matplotlib, PIL imports

#**- You can add folders of images and train based on that using model_use.py -**
Please specify the names of the folders accordingly to avoid confusion.
#**- If you want to test the model please add the images to the untested folder, and change that in the final line of model_use.py -**
Current datasets are enough to run, but change them if you want to use it for other purposes.

**This program will require you to run the training.py file before the model_use.py, otherwise there will be no model to use in model_use.py**
